                With heavy hearts, the family of Bausten Riley Jech announces his passing on February 18, 2019 in Oklahoma City, OK.

Bausten went on to earn his Bachelor of Science degree in 2016 from the University of Central Oklahoma. Throughout his college career, Bausten worked at Results Fitness in Edmond.

                Bausten had the purest heart a person could have, he cared deeply for all living things, especially his friends and family. His caring was evident in his everyday actions; always making sure others were cared for. He was content to spend time and get to know you over a craft beer. He took great care to give personal gifts and took joy in the act of sharing an experience with you. His ambitions were for the simple things; he loved nature, traveling and adventures, and spending time with loved ones. Bausten blazed his own trail through life, <strong>he was a renegade with a heart of gold</strong>, and he will be deeply missed.
